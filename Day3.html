    <h2>How to Make Nested List?</h2>
    <p>Nested list means list inside list.</p>
    <p>You can make any of these nested list in HTML.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordered list inside Unordered list.</li>
        <li>Unordered list inside Ordered list.</li>
        <li>Ordered list inside Ordered list.</li>
        <li>Unordered list inside Unordered list.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>How to make table in HTML?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We all know that in table there are rows and columns.</li>
        <li>Rows are horizontal arrangement of cells whereas columns are vertical arrangement of cells.</li>
        <li>In HTML we have to learn how to create row and column to form a table.</li>
        <li>So whenever you want to create a table firstly you have to use table tag to declare that you are going to create a table.</li>
        <li>To create the border of the table you have to write inside the table tag border="1".</li>
        <li>To create or add the row in the table you have to use tr tag.</li>
        <li>Inside the tr tag you have to use td tag to fill the data in the row.</li>
        <li>To highlight the headings of table you have to use th tag inside the tr tag.</li>
        <li>Inside the table tag it is recommended to use three tags which represent the three parts of the table. 
            <ol>
                <li>thead: Inside this tag we will write heading of the table using th tag.</li>
                <li>tbody: This tag contains body of the table.</li>
                <li>tfoot: This tag contains conclusion of the table.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>To extend column we use colspan tag. While using this tag we have to give the value of colspan according to this that how many columns it is going to cover.If it is going to cover 3 columns then the value of colspan is equal to 3. </li>
        <li>Similarly to extend row we use rowspan tag. While using this tag we have to give the value of rowspan according to this that how many rows it is going to cover.If it is going to cover 2 rows then the value of rowspan is equal to 2. </li>
        <li>You can also use both rowspan and colspan together as well.</li>
    </ul>
