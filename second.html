    <h2>Why We  Need To Use Tags In HTML?</h2>
    <p>If we don't use tags in HTML then it will show our whole content just like article without any heading and without any gap between paragraphs.</p>
    <p>That's why it is essential to use tags to provide proper structure to our content.</p>
    <p>Tags are used to provide semantic meaning and proper structure to the words that we have written in HTML file.</p>
    <p>And this is what we meant by markup language.</p>
    <h2>TAGS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heading Tags:It gives semantic meaning to the content.
            <p>There are 6 levels of heading.</p>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <td>h1</td>
                    <td>Heading of web page.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>h2</td>
                    <td>Sub heading of h1</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>h3</td>
                    <td>Sub Heading of h2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>h4</td>
                    <td>Sub heading of h3</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>h5</td>
                    <td>Sub Heading of h4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>h6</td>
